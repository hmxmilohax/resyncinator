# Repackinator

## Simple tool to add or subtract audio delay in gh1/gh2/gh80s isos

# Requirements
## Windows
* Python
* 7-Zip
## Linux
* Python
* Wine
* 7-Zip installed in default wineprefix

# Usage
* Drag in a gh1/gh2/gh80s/custom iso into the "main" folder
* Only do one iso at a time
### OR
* Extract **ALL FILES** from your gh1/gh2/gh80s/custom iso to the "main" folder
* Only do one disc at a time
### OR
* add any arbitrary .vgs files to the "main" folder (will skip iso generation)
* open a command prompt to the resyncinator directory `cd C:/path/to/repackinator`
* Run `python repackinator.py`
* Optionally, you can include the desired ms value as an argument (default -60) `python repackinator.py 100`
* Sit back and let the program run to completion
* If your input file is an ISO, you can find your original iso untouched in `/main/_processed_original_isos/`
* When done, you will be asked whether or not to also generate a new ISO
* This ISO will be a PS2 Master Disc ISO, it will work via MechaPWN with no additional patches thanks to included [PS2 Master Disc Patcher](https://www.psx-place.com/threads/playstation-2-master-disc-patcher-for-mechapwn.36547/page-3#post-393254)
